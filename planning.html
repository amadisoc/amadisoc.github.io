        <p>This website is concept for a Weather forecast servicing website, akin to many other such websites on the web. Because we didn't have enough websites dedicated to the weather, I guess. The cool blue colors act as a suble relaxing agent that boosts the experiance of the user.</p>
        	<section id="persona">
				<h2>Persona</h2>
				<p>Male, 23. Just a casual observer of the universe. Wants as many kitten pictures as he can get his hands on. Works part-time as a guy who pretends to be someone he is not. Graduated from Strangereal High School and has been an apprentice pianist. Has a hobby in Photography. This website would appeal to Datt because it is an easy resource as well as a complete and welcoming website.</p>

				<h2>Persona #2</h2>
				<p>Female, 23. Fanatically curious about life, the universe, and everything. Likes to collect yarn and yarn accessories. Works full-time as a seamstress and as a political activist.
